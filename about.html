          <h2>About Me </h2>
          <p>I transform complex data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions—whether in finance, retail, or tech. My sweet spot? Bridging the gap between raw data and boardroom-ready narratives using:

            Power BI (Build once, deploy everywhere)
            
            Microsoft Fabric (Certified Analytics Engineer) for seamless ETL and OneLake governance
            
            SQL/T-SQL for dimensional modeling and ad-hoc analysis
            
            Beyond dashboards, I thrive in cross-functional teams, collaborating with:
            
            Data Engineers and Administrators to optimize pipelines (basic SSIS/ETL exposure)
            
            Stakeholders to distill technical findings into simplified language(s)
            
            Junior analysts to upskill on data best practices
            
            Currently enrolled in the FNB App Acadamy in web and app development (HTML/CSS)—proof that I’m always stretching my skills to speak tech’s many dialects</p>
